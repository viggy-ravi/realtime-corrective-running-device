 Device takes in four pressure sensor inputs (two on the balls of the feet and two 
 on the heels) to determine if a heel-striking occurs at midstance. Once pressure
 has been detected, two inertial sensor inputs are read (one from the hip and one 
 from the ankle) and stored, and calculations for the hip-ankle angle at midstance
 are made.
  
 Sound outputs occur for heel striking (heel pressure sensor goes high before pressure
 sensor on balls of feet) and hip-ankle angle greater than 15 degrees (0.261799 rads).
